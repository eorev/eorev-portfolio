            <p className="my-4 text-primary-200">
                Computer science and artificial intelligence are often perceived as
                fields focused merely on technical advancements. However, at their core,
                they are powerful tools with the potential to enhance our daily lives
                profoundly. My ambition is to delve into the intricacies of human
                nature, unraveling what motivates us each day, and apply these insights
                in synergy with AI. By integrating these ideologies, I am dedicated to
                creating innovative solutions that not only streamline our daily tasks
                but also enrich our experiences, making every day more fulfilling. Itâ€™s
                a journey towards leveraging technology to harmonize with our human
                essence, transforming how we live and interact.
